- Task repetition/recurring task functionality

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… Quick task creation from main interface
- âœ… Task list displays with clear visual hierarchy
- âœ… Edit task details without losing context
- âœ… Tasks persist across app restarts
- âœ… Completed tasks are visually distinguished
- âœ… Subtasks can be created and managed
- âœ… Recurring tasks automatically generate new instances
- âœ… Reminder notifications for due dates

### 2. Task-Pomodoro Integration
**User Story**: As a user, I want to associate tasks with pomodoro sessions to track focused work time on specific items.

**Requirements**:
- Assign active task to current pomodoro session
- Quick task selection before starting timer
- Automatic task switching between pomodoros
- Track completed pomodoros per task with estimation comparison
- Show task progress during timer countdown
- Estimated pomodoro count per task for goal setting

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… Task selector visible when starting pomodoro
- âœ… Current task displayed prominently during session
- âœ… Completed pomodoros automatically linked to tasks
- âœ… Unfinished sessions are tracked separately
- âœ… Task can be changed during active session
- âœ… Estimated vs actual pomodoro comparison displayed
- âœ… Task workload estimation helps with planning

### 3. Task Categories & Organization
**User Story**: As a user, I want to organize tasks into categories to better manage different areas of work.

**Requirements**:
- Create custom task categories/projects with full project management support
- Assign tasks to categories with hierarchical organization
- Color-coded category identification
- Filter tasks by category with advanced filtering
- Category-based analytics and time tracking
- Project-level progress tracking and reporting

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… Intuitive category creation and management
- âœ… Visual category indicators in task list
- âœ… Category filter maintains current session context
- âœ… Default "Uncategorized" for unassigned tasks
- âœ… Category deletion reassigns tasks appropriately
- âœ… Project-level analytics show time distribution
- âœ… Hierarchical project organization supported

### 4. Task Prioritization & Scheduling
**User Story**: As a user, I want to prioritize tasks and see what I should work on next.

**Requirements**:
- Three priority levels with visual indicators
- "Today" task designation for daily focus
- Overdue task highlighting
- Smart task suggestions based on priority/due date
- Manual task ordering within categories

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… Clear priority visual hierarchy
- âœ… Today's tasks prominently displayed
- âœ… Overdue tasks are clearly marked
- âœ… Next task suggestions appear before timer start
- âœ… Drag-and-drop task reordering

### 5. Task Analytics & Tracking
**User Story**: As a user, I want to see how much focused time I've spent on different tasks and categories.

**Requirements**:
- Detailed time tracking per task (completed pomodoros)
- Category/project-based time analytics with time ratio calculations
- Task completion rate statistics and trends
- Daily/weekly/monthly task progress summaries
- Estimated vs actual time comparisons with accuracy metrics
- Gantt chart visualization for task timelines
- Comprehensive reports on task completion and time distribution

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… Accurate time tracking per task with detailed statistics
- âœ… Visual progress indicators on tasks
- âœ… Category breakdown in analytics view with time ratios
- âœ… Historical task completion trends
- âœ… Export task time data in multiple formats
- âœ… Gantt chart shows task timeline and dependencies
- âœ… Daily/weekly/monthly calendar view of task completion
- âœ… Time distribution analysis across projects

## User Interface Requirements

### Design Principles
- **Contextual**: Task management integrates naturally with timer
- **Non-Intrusive**: Tasks support but don't overshadow pomodoro focus
- **Quick Access**: Primary task operations require minimal interaction
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear task status and priority indicators

### Integration Points
- Task selector in timer start interface
- Compact task list in sidebar/panel
- Task progress in timer display
- Quick task creation shortcut
- Task completion celebration integration

### Mobile-First Considerations
- Touch-friendly task interaction
- Swipe gestures for task operations
- Compact task display for smaller screens
- Voice task creation support (future)

## Technical Requirements

### Data Model
```
Task {
  id: UUID
  title: string
  description?: string
  category_id?: UUID
  priority: "high" | "normal" | "low"
  due_date?: Date
  created_at: Date
  completed_at?: Date
  estimated_pomodoros?: number
  actual_pomodoros: number
}

Category {
  id: UUID
  name: string
  color: string
  created_at: Date
}

TaskSession {
