## Document Info
- **Created**: December 2024
- **Version**: v1.0
- **Status**: Requirements Review
- **Owner**: Development Team

## Project Overview

### Background
Develop a desktop productivity timer based on the Pomodoro Technique to help users improve work efficiency and focus.

### Objectives
- Provide simple, intuitive pomodoro timing functionality
- Support customizable time intervals
- Offer focus analytics and progress tracking
- Deliver distraction-free user experience

## Core Features

### 1. Timer Functionality
**User Story**: As a user, I want to start a 25-minute focus session to work efficiently.

**Requirements**:
- Default 25-minute work sessions + 5-minute short breaks
- Long break (15-30 minutes) after 4 completed pomodoros
- Start, pause, stop, and reset controls
- Automatic progression between work/break phases

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Timer starts countdown when start button is clicked
- ‚úÖ Display remaining time in MM:SS format
- ‚úÖ Support pause and resume functionality
- ‚úÖ Play notification sound when time expires
- ‚úÖ Automatically switch between work/break modes

### 2. Customization Settings
**User Story**: As a user, I want to customize work and break durations to match my workflow.

**Requirements**:
- Custom work duration (15-60 minutes)
- Custom short break duration (5-15 minutes)
- Custom long break duration (15-30 minutes)
- Configurable long break interval (2-8 pomodoros)
- Audio notification options and mute setting
- Desktop notification preferences

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Settings panel allows time parameter modification
- ‚úÖ Settings apply immediately without affecting current timer
- ‚úÖ Settings persist across app restarts
- ‚úÖ Preset templates available (Classic, Short, Extended)

### 3. Status & Notifications
**User Story**: As a user, I want clear indication of my current session state and when to switch between work and rest.

**Requirements**:
- Visual status indicators (Working/Break/Paused)
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- System tray icon state changes
- Desktop notification alerts
- Optional audio notifications

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Interface clearly shows current state and remaining time
- ‚úÖ Tray icon reflects current session status
- ‚úÖ Desktop notification sent when timer expires
- ‚úÖ Multiple notification sound options
- ‚úÖ Audio can be disabled while keeping visual alerts

### 4. Analytics & Statistics
**User Story**: As a user, I want to view my focus history and statistics to understand my productivity patterns.

**Requirements**:
- Track daily completed pomodoro sessions
- Show today/week/month summaries
- Total focus time calculations
- Completion rate metrics (completed vs interrupted)
- Simple trend visualization

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Accurately record each completed pomodoro
- ‚úÖ Distinguish between completed and interrupted sessions
- ‚úÖ Calendar view for historical data
- ‚úÖ Display key statistics and trends
- ‚úÖ Local data storage with persistence

## User Interface Requirements

### Design Principles
- **Minimalist**: Clean interface with minimal distractions
- **Clear Display**: Large, readable time display
- **Obvious Status**: Current state immediately apparent
- **Simple Operations**: Primary actions require ‚â§2 clicks

### Desktop Features
- Always-on-top window option
- System tray minimization
- Global keyboard shortcuts (start/pause/stop)
- Compact mode for minimal screen space
- Remember window position and size on startup

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Standards
- Timer accuracy: ¬±1 second maximum deviation
- Application startup: <3 seconds
- Memory usage: <50MB during operation
- CPU usage: <1% during normal operation

### Platform Compatibility
- Windows 10/11 support
- macOS 10.15+ support
- Major Linux distributions
- High-DPI display compatibility

### Data Management
- Local SQLite database for analytics
- JSON configuration files
- Data export functionality

## Scope & Constraints

### Excluded Features (v1.0)
- Task management capabilities
- Cloud synchronization
- Advanced reporting dashboards
- Social sharing features
- Team collaboration tools

### Design Constraints
- Minimal animations to maintain performance
- Offline-only operation (no network dependency)
- Multi-language support (English/Chinese priority)
- Platform-specific design guidelines compliance

## User Experience Standards

### Usability
- Intuitive operation without tutorials
- Primary functions visible on main interface
- Contextual help and tooltips
- Clear error messages and guidance

### Accessibility
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Colorblind-friendly color schemes
- High contrast mode option
- Adjustable font sizes

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing

## Open Questions

1. **Theme Support**: Dark mode implementation? Theme switching capability?
2. **Audio Design**: Notification sound types? Gradual volume increase?
3. **Data Export**: Required formats? Is CSV sufficient?
4. **Shortcuts**: Global hotkeys necessary? Potential conflicts with other apps?
5. **Window Behavior**: Transparency adjustment? Rounded window corners?
6. **Distribution**: Portable version needed? Installer size constraints?

## Change History
