**Feature Branch**: `004-review`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ÂØπÂΩìÂâçÈ°πÁõÆËøõË°åreviewÔºå‰ºòÂåñ‰ª£Á†ÅÔºåÂú®‰øùËØÅÂäüËÉΩÊ≠£Â∏∏ÁöÑÂâçÊèê‰∏ãÔºåÁ≤æÁÆÄ‰ºòÂåñ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Code review and optimization request for current project
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Development team, Code maintainers
   ‚Üí Actions: Review code, Optimize, Streamline, Maintain functionality
   ‚Üí Data: Existing codebase, Performance metrics, Code quality metrics
   ‚Üí Constraints: Preserve functionality, Maintain existing behavior
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Optimization scope and priorities defined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Code quality improvement workflow established
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements focused on code quality and optimization
6. Identify Key Entities (codebase components)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí Focus on user value (maintainable, efficient code)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What specific performance metrics should be prioritized for measurement and optimization? ‚Üí A: All of the above with equal priority
- Q: What criteria should be used to identify code as "truly redundant" for removal? ‚Üí A: All duplicate code regardless of purpose
- Q: What specific criteria should be used to measure improved code readability and maintainability? ‚Üí A: Better code organization and structure
- Q: When optimization changes conflict with preserving existing functionality, what should be the resolution approach? ‚Üí A: Apply optimization only where no functional risk exists

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I want the codebase to be reviewed and optimized so that the project maintains excellent code quality, performance, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing codebase with multiple components, **When** optimization is performed, **Then** code becomes more readable and maintainable without breaking functionality
2. **Given** potentially redundant or inefficient code sections, **When** review is conducted, **Then** unnecessary code is removed while preserving core features
3. **Given** complex code structures, **When** optimization is applied, **Then** code is simplified without losing functionality
4. **Given** the current working application, **When** optimization is complete, **Then** all existing features continue to work exactly as before
5. **Given** performance metrics before optimization, **When** optimization is complete, **Then** performance is maintained or improved

### Edge Cases
- What happens when optimization conflicts with existing functionality? ‚Üí Apply optimization only where no functional risk exists
- How does the system handle cases where code appears redundant but serves a hidden purpose?
- How is backward compatibility maintained during optimization?
- What happens if optimization introduces subtle behavioral changes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality during optimization process
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain current user interface behavior and appearance
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify and remove all duplicate code regardless of original purpose or context
- **FR-004**: System MUST simplify complex code structures where possible
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain or improve all performance metrics including load time, memory usage, code execution efficiency, and bundle size
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve data persistence and state management functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain cross-browser compatibility
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve responsive design behavior
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain accessibility features
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve API integration capabilities
- **FR-011**: System MUST improve code organization and structure to enhance readability and maintainability
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain proper error handling and validation
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve user experience and interaction patterns
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain development and build processes
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve documentation and comments where valuable

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Frontend Application**: Single-page web application requiring optimization review
- **Component Architecture**: UI components that need structural analysis
- **State Management**: Application state handling that requires efficiency review
- **CSS/Styling System**: Styling approach that may benefit from consolidation
- **JavaScript Functions**: Code logic that requires complexity analysis
- **Data Models**: Data structures used throughout the application
- **API Integration Layer**: Backend communication interfaces
- **Performance Metrics**: Measurements of application efficiency and speed
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Measures of maintainability, readability, and structure
