# Documentation Structure Contract

## Overview
This contract defines the required structure and content for frontend design documentation. It serves as a validation schema for completeness and consistency.

## Required Document Sections

### 1. Design Overview Section
**Contract**: Every design document MUST contain
```markdown
# [Feature] Frontend Design Documentation

## üéØ Design Goals
- [Primary objective]
- [Secondary objectives]
- [Success criteria]

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
- [Layout approach]
- [Navigation structure]
- [Component hierarchy]

## üì± Responsive Strategy
- [Mobile breakpoint: <768px]
- [Tablet breakpoint: 768-1024px]
- [Desktop breakpoint: >1024px]
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Must have exactly 3 responsive breakpoints
- Architecture overview must mention navigation approach
- Success criteria must be measurable

### 2. Component Specifications Section
**Contract**: Each UI component MUST have
```markdown
## [ComponentName] Component

### Purpose
[What this component does]

### Props/Inputs
| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| [prop] | [type] | [yes/no] | [value] | [purpose] |

### Visual States
- **Default**: [description]
- **Hover**: [description]
- **Active**: [description]
- **Disabled**: [description]

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: [tab order, focus behavior]
- **Screen Reader**: [aria labels, semantic structure]

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile**: [layout changes]
- **Tablet**: [layout changes]
- **Desktop**: [layout changes]

### Wireframe
```
[ASCII wireframe showing component layout]
```
```

**Validation Rules**:
- All interactive components must have hover and active states
- Keyboard navigation must be specified for all interactive elements
- Wireframes must fit within 80 character width
- At least 3 visual states must be documented

### 3. Interaction Flows Section
**Contract**: Each user flow MUST contain
```markdown
## [FlowName] Interaction Flow

### Trigger Conditions
- [When this flow starts]

### Success Path
1. [User action] ‚Üí [System response]
2. [User action] ‚Üí [System response]
3. [Completion state]

### Error Paths
- **Error Condition**: [What went wrong] ‚Üí [Recovery action]
- **Edge Case**: [Unusual scenario] ‚Üí [Fallback behavior]

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: [timing requirement]
- **Loading States**: [when to show loading indicators]

### Accessibility Flow
- **Keyboard Path**: [how to complete flow with keyboard only]
- **Screen Reader**: [announcements and landmarks]
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Success path must have at least 3 steps
- At least 2 error conditions must be documented
- Performance requirements must include specific timing
- Keyboard flow must be complete and testable

### 4. Integration Points Section
**Contract**: Backend integration MUST specify
```markdown
## Backend Integration

### API Endpoints Used
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Data Binding |
|----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| [url] | [GET/POST] | [purpose] | [UI component] |

### Data Flow
- **Component** ‚Üí **API Call** ‚Üí **Response** ‚Üí **UI Update**
- [component] ‚Üí [endpoint] ‚Üí [data structure] ‚Üí [visual change]

### Error Handling
- **Network Error**: [user experience]
- **API Error**: [error message display]
- **Timeout**: [retry mechanism]

### Offline Behavior
- [What works offline]
- [What requires connection]
- [Sync strategy]
```

**Validation Rules**:
- All API endpoints must reference existing backend documentation
- Error handling must cover network, API, and timeout scenarios
- Offline behavior must be specified for all interactive features
- Data binding must map to specific UI components

## Content Quality Standards

### Writing Style Requirements
- Use active voice for user actions ("User clicks" not "Button is clicked")
- Include specific measurements (320px, 2 seconds, 80% width)
- Avoid subjective terms ("intuitive", "user-friendly") without metrics
- Use consistent terminology throughout document

### Visual Documentation Standards
- ASCII wireframes must use consistent symbols
- Component boundaries clearly marked with ASCII art
- Spacing and alignment must be consistent
- Labels must be clear and unambiguous

### Cross-Reference Requirements
- All component references must link to component specifications
- All API references must link to backend documentation
- All interaction flows must reference user scenarios
- All migration notes must identify specific affected files

## Validation Checklist

### Structure Completeness
- [ ] Design overview section present
- [ ] All components have complete specifications
- [ ] All interaction flows documented
- [ ] Integration points specified
- [ ] Migration impact assessed

### Content Quality
- [ ] All measurements are specific and numeric
- [ ] All timing requirements are measurable
- [ ] All accessibility requirements are testable
- [ ] All error scenarios have specified handling

### Cross-Reference Integrity
- [ ] All component references resolve correctly
