# Data Model: Frontend Project-First UI Design Documentation

## Entity Overview

This feature involves documentation entities rather than runtime data models. The entities represent the structure and content of design documentation that will guide frontend implementation.

## Core Entities

### 1. Design Document
**Purpose**: Comprehensive specification covering layout, interactions, and visual standards

**Attributes**:
- `section_hierarchy`: Structured organization of documentation sections
- `wireframe_layouts`: ASCII wireframes showing component placement
- `interaction_specifications`: User flow definitions and state transitions
- `responsive_guidelines`: Breakpoint specifications and layout adaptations
- `version`: Document version for change tracking
- `last_updated`: Timestamp for maintenance tracking
- `approval_status`: Review and approval state

**Relationships**:
- Contains multiple UI Component Specifications
- References existing Backend API endpoints
- Links to Implementation Guidelines
- Belongs to Project Documentation Set

**Business Rules**:
- Must be version controlled with Git
- Requires approval for major navigation changes
- Must maintain consistency across all sections
- Must reference existing backend API structure

**Validation Rules**:
- All wireframes must include component labels
- Responsive guidelines must cover mobile, tablet, desktop
- Interaction specifications must include error states
- Version increments required for breaking changes

### 2. UI Component Specification
**Purpose**: Detailed definition of reusable interface elements

**Attributes**:
- `component_name`: Unique identifier (e.g., "ProjectSidebar", "TaskCard")
- `component_type`: Category (navigation, content, interaction, display)
- `props_inputs`: Expected data inputs and configuration options
- `visual_states`: Different appearances (default, hover, active, disabled)
- `accessibility_requirements`: Keyboard navigation and focus behavior
- `responsive_behavior`: Behavior across different screen sizes
- `interaction_events`: User actions and system responses
- `dependencies`: Other components or services required

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to Design Document sections
- Implements Design Patterns
- May contain child components (composition)
- Maps to Backend API data structures

**Business Rules**:
- Must include mobile and desktop variants
- Requires accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation)
- Must follow consistent naming conventions
- Should be reusable across multiple contexts

**State Transitions**:
```
Draft → Review → Approved → Implemented → Validated
     ↑_______________________________________|
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Component names must be unique within scope
- All visual states must be documented
- Accessibility requirements must be testable
- Props must specify types and default values

### 3. Interaction Flow
**Purpose**: Step-by-step user journey documentation for key workflows

**Attributes**:
- `flow_name`: Descriptive identifier (e.g., "TaskToPomodoro", "ProjectSwitching")
- `trigger_conditions`: Events or states that initiate the flow
- `sequence_steps`: Ordered list of user actions and system responses
- `completion_criteria`: Success and failure end states
- `error_handling_paths`: Alternative flows for error conditions
- `performance_requirements`: Timing and responsiveness constraints
- `accessibility_notes`: Keyboard navigation and screen reader considerations

**Relationships**:
- Connects multiple UI Components
- References User Scenarios from specification
- Maps to Backend API call sequences
- Links to Migration Checklists

**Business Rules**:
- Must be testable through user scenarios
- Should include error handling paths
- Must specify timing requirements
- Should support accessibility navigation

**Lifecycle States**:
- `inactive`: Flow not triggered
- `in_progress`: User is in the middle of the flow
- `completed`: Flow finished successfully
- `error`: Flow encountered error condition
- `abandoned`: User left flow incomplete

**Validation Rules**:
- All steps must have clear success criteria
- Error paths must lead to recovery or graceful exit
- Performance requirements must be measurable
- Accessibility paths must be documented

## Integration Points

### Backend API Integration
**Data Binding Patterns**:
- Project data: Maps to existing Project Management API
- Task data: Integrates with Task entities from backend
- Session data: Connects to Pomodoro session tracking
- Statistics: Real-time calculation from backend aggregations

**API Endpoint Mapping**:
- `GET /v1/projects` → Project list component data
- `GET /v1/projects/{id}/tasks` → Task list component data
- `POST /v1/pomodoro/sessions` → Pomodoro timer integration
- `GET /v1/projects/{id}/statistics` → Project stats display

### Local Storage Integration
**Client-Side State**:
- Current project selection: Persisted across sessions
- UI preferences: Theme, layout customizations
- Draft states: Unsaved form data and user inputs
- Navigation state: Active sections and expanded panels

## Documentation Constraints

### Content Structure Constraints
- Maximum 3 levels of heading hierarchy
- Component specs limited to 2 pages each
- Interaction flows max 10 steps per sequence
- Wireframes must fit standard terminal width (80 chars)

### Accessibility Constraints
- All interactive elements must support keyboard navigation
- Focus order must be logical and predictable
- Visual indicators required for all state changes
- Alternative text required for all visual elements

### Performance Constraints
- Documentation load time <2 seconds
- Wireframe rendering <1 second
- Component lookup <500ms
- Search functionality <100ms response

### Migration Constraints
- Must identify all affected existing components
- Breaking changes require explicit callouts
- Backward compatibility notes for gradual migration
- Rollback procedures for failed migrations

## Validation Framework

### Documentation Completeness
- [ ] All components have complete specifications
- [ ] All interaction flows include error handling
- [ ] All wireframes have component labels
- [ ] All accessibility requirements documented

### Integration Consistency
- [ ] Backend API references are accurate
- [ ] Component data bindings are specified
- [ ] Performance requirements are measurable
- [ ] Migration impact is assessed

### Quality Standards
- [ ] Naming conventions followed consistently
- [ ] Visual hierarchy is clear and logical
- [ ] Cross-references are accurate and complete
- [ ] Version control history is maintained

This data model provides the foundation for creating comprehensive, consistent, and implementable design documentation that meets all constitutional and functional requirements.
