**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ÂàöÊâçÁöÑËÆæËÆ°ÊñπÊ°àÂ¢ûÂä†Âà∞ËÆ®ËÆ∫‰∏≠"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Document optimized frontend design with project-first architecture
   ‚Üí Context: Previous design discussion established left sidebar navigation and project-centric UI
   ‚Üí Goal: Formalize design decisions into project documentation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Frontend developers, UI/UX designers, product stakeholders
   ‚Üí Actions: Document design patterns, create UI specifications, establish navigation structure
   ‚Üí Data: Design layouts, component hierarchies, interaction flows
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must integrate with existing backend project management API
3. For each unclear aspect:
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Design team references documentation ‚Üí implements UI components
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Documentation structure, content completeness, accessibility standards
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Design documents, UI components, interaction patterns
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - 2 clarification points"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What format should the visual documentation take? ‚Üí A: Wireframes showing layout structure and component placement only
- Q: What accessibility standard should the documentation target? ‚Üí A: Basic keyboard navigation only (tab order and focus management)
- Q: How extensive should the migration documentation be? ‚Üí A: Checklist of affected components requiring manual review

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a frontend developer working on the Pomodoro Genie application, I want comprehensive design documentation that specifies the project-first UI architecture, so I can implement consistent user interfaces that prioritize project management over individual task management, enabling users to organize their work more effectively.

**Example Flow**:
1. Developer accesses design documentation during implementation phase
2. Developer reviews left sidebar navigation specifications
3. Developer implements project list with task filtering capabilities
4. Developer creates Pomodoro timer integration following documented interaction patterns
5. Designer reviews implementation against documented specifications
6. User testing validates project-first workflow effectiveness

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a frontend developer starting UI implementation, **When** I access the design documentation, **Then** I find complete specifications for left sidebar navigation with project hierarchy
2. **Given** I need to implement task-to-Pomodoro transitions, **When** I reference the interaction flow documentation, **Then** I understand exactly how users navigate from task lists to focused timer sessions
3. **Given** I am implementing responsive design, **When** I check the layout specifications, **Then** I have clear guidance for mobile and desktop breakpoints
4. **Given** I am a designer reviewing implementation, **When** I compare built components against documentation, **Then** I can verify consistency with approved design patterns
5. **Given** new team members join the project, **When** they read the design documentation, **Then** they understand the project-first philosophy and navigation structure without additional explanation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documentation conflicts with existing implemented UI?
  - Documentation should include migration checklist identifying affected components requiring manual review
- How are design decisions tracked when requirements change?
  - Version control should maintain design decision history with rationale
- What level of detail is needed for complex interactions like Pomodoro timer states?
  - All timer states (idle, running, paused, break) must be documented with visual indicators

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Documentation Structure**
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide comprehensive design documentation covering left sidebar navigation architecture
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST specify project-first UI hierarchy with clear visual organization principles
- **FR-003**: System MUST document task-to-Pomodoro interaction flows with step-by-step user journeys
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST include responsive design guidelines for mobile and desktop viewports
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide component specifications for project list, task list, and timer interfaces

**Design Pattern Standards**
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST establish consistent color schemes and typography for project management interface
- **FR-007**: System MUST specify icon usage standards for projects, tasks, and Pomodoro states
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST define spacing and layout grid systems for consistent component alignment
- **FR-009**: System MUST include basic accessibility guidelines for keyboard navigation (tab order and focus management)
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST specify animation and transition standards for state changes

**Integration Requirements**
- **FR-011**: Design documentation MUST align with existing backend project management API structure
- **FR-012**: System MUST document data binding patterns for project statistics and task completion tracking
- **FR-013**: Documentation MUST specify error state handling for API connection issues
- **FR-014**: System MUST include loading state specifications for project and task data fetching
- **FR-015**: Documentation MUST define offline behavior patterns for local data persistence

**Navigation Architecture**
- **FR-016**: System MUST document left sidebar navigation structure with project list as primary navigation
- **FR-017**: Documentation MUST specify main navigation items: Projects, Pomodoro Timer, Tasks, Reports, Settings
