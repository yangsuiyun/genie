## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: Can tasks exist independently without belonging to a project? ‚Üí A: Tasks MUST always belong to a project (no orphan tasks allowed)
- Q: Should projects support nesting (sub-projects)? ‚Üí A: No nesting - flat project structure only
- Q: Can tasks in completed/archived projects still be accessed or executed? ‚Üí A: Full access - tasks remain fully functional (modify, execute Pomodoro)
- Q: When a user first starts using the system with no projects, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Auto-create a default "Inbox" or "General" project for immediate task creation
- Q: How should a project's completion status be determined? ‚Üí A: Manual only - user explicitly marks project as complete regardless of task status

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a productivity-focused user, I want to organize my work through projects that contain multiple related tasks, so I can focus on project goals rather than isolated tasks. When I'm ready to work, I select a task within a project and use the Pomodoro technique to execute it, tracking time and progress at both task and project levels.

**Example Flow**:
1. User creates a project "Website Redesign"
2. User adds tasks: "Design mockups", "Implement header", "User testing"
3. User views project dashboard showing all tasks and overall progress
4. User selects task "Design mockups" and starts a Pomodoro session
5. After completing multiple Pomodoro sessions, task progress updates
6. User sees project-level statistics: total time spent, tasks completed, estimated completion

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user with no projects, **When** I first access the system, **Then** a default "Inbox" project is automatically created for immediate task creation
2. **Given** I have the default "Inbox" project, **When** I create a new project "Mobile App Development", **Then** both projects are displayed in my project list
3. **Given** I have a project "Mobile App Development", **When** I add 5 tasks to it, **Then** all tasks appear under this project with clear hierarchy
4. **Given** I select a task "Write API tests", **When** I start a Pomodoro timer, **Then** the session is tracked and associated with both the task and its parent project
5. **Given** I have a project with 10 tasks (3 completed, 7 pending), **When** I view the project dashboard, **Then** I see: completion percentage, total time invested, remaining tasks, estimated time to completion
6. **Given** I complete all tasks in a project, **When** I manually mark the project as complete, **Then** the project status changes to completed with summary statistics
7. **Given** I have a project with pending tasks, **When** I manually mark it as complete, **Then** the system allows completion regardless of task status
8. **Given** I have multiple projects, **When** I view the project list, **Then** projects are displayed with: name, task count, progress percentage, last active date, completion status

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a task is started via Pomodoro but its parent project is deleted?
  - Tasks are deleted along with the project (cascade deletion enforced); exception: default "Inbox" project cannot be deleted
- How does the system handle a project with 0 tasks?
  - Should display as empty project with option to add tasks
- What happens when a Pomodoro session is interrupted mid-way?
  - Session should be saved as incomplete, time logged to task/project
- How are tasks displayed when they belong to archived/completed projects?
  - Tasks remain fully accessible with full functionality (can modify task details and execute new Pomodoro sessions)
- What happens when a user tries to start multiple Pomodoro sessions across different project tasks simultaneously?
  - System should enforce one active Pomodoro session at a time
- Can the default "Inbox" project be deleted or renamed?
  - Cannot be deleted (system enforced); can be renamed by user

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Project Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically create a default "Inbox" project on first user access

- **FR-024**: System MUST provide daily/weekly/monthly view of Pomodoro activity grouped by project
- **FR-025**: System MUST allow filtering task list by project

**Navigation & UI**
- **FR-026**: System MUST provide a project-first navigation structure where users see projects before tasks

- **FR-028**: System MUST display current project context when executing a task with Pomodoro timer
- **FR-029**: System MUST show breadcrumb navigation: Project ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Pomodoro Session

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Project**: Represents a collection of related tasks working towards a common goal
  - Attributes: Name, Description, Creation Date, Completion Status (user-controlled), Task Count, Total Pomodoro Count, Is Default (boolean flag for "Inbox")
  - Relationships: Contains multiple Tasks, aggregates Pomodoro Sessions through Tasks
  - Business Rules: Must have a unique name, completion status set manually by user (independent of task completion), flat structure with no sub-project nesting allowed, default "Inbox" project auto-created on first access and cannot be deleted

- **Task**: Represents an individual work item that belongs to a project
  - Attributes: Name, Description, Priority, Due Date, Completion Status, Estimated Pomodoros, Completed Pomodoros, Parent Project Reference (required)
  - Relationships: Belongs to exactly one Project (mandatory), can have multiple Pomodoro Sessions
  - Business Rules: Must always have a parent project; cannot exist as orphan; deleted when parent project is deleted (cascade)

- **Pomodoro Session**: Represents a focused work period on a specific task
  - Attributes: Start Time, End Time, Duration, Session Type (work/break), Task Reference, Project Reference
  - Relationships: Belongs to one Task, indirectly associated with one Project
  - Business Rules: Duration follows Pomodoro technique (25-minute work, 5-minute break), must be linked to a task
