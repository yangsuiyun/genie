## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to improve their productivity using the Pomodoro Technique. They create tasks with due dates and reminders, break them into subtasks, and use the Pomodoro timer to focus on work sessions. During breaks, they add notes to track progress. At the end of the week, they review reports showing completed tasks and time spent. They access the application from multiple devices (phone, tablet, computer) and expect their data to stay synchronized.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has created a task with subtasks and configured their preferred Pomodoro duration, **When** they start a Pomodoro timer for that task, **Then** the timer counts down for their configured duration and notifies them when the work session is complete
2. **Given** a task has a due date set for today, **When** the due time approaches, **Then** the system sends a reminder notification to the user at the configured time (default 15 minutes before)
3. **Given** a user has completed multiple Pomodoro sessions, **When** they view their weekly report, **Then** they see the number of completed sessions, tasks finished, and time distribution across different tasks
4. **Given** a user creates a task on their phone, **When** they open the app on their computer, **Then** the task appears with all its details (subtasks, notes, timer history) synchronized
5. **Given** a user sets a task to repeat weekly, **When** the task is marked complete, **Then** a new instance of the task is automatically created for the next week
6. **Given** a Pomodoro session is in progress, **When** the user needs to take a break, **Then** they can pause or stop the timer and add notes about their progress

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user loses internet connectivity while working offline? Changes are stored locally and synced when reconnected using last-write-wins strategy.
- The system sends push notifications with sound alerts when timers complete, even when the app is closed or in the background.
- What happens to recurring tasks if a user deletes the entire series vs. a single instance?
- When the same task is edited on two different devices simultaneously, the most recent modification (by timestamp) overwrites earlier changes.
- What happens when a task's due date is in the past?
- How does the system handle timezone differences when syncing across devices in different locations?

### Key Entities

- **Task**: Represents a unit of work with attributes including title, description, due date/time, completion status, creation timestamp, and recurrence rules. A task can contain multiple subtasks and notes, and is associated with Pomodoro sessions.

- **Subtask**: A smaller unit of work belonging to a parent task, with title and completion status.

- **Pomodoro Session**: A timed work session linked to a specific task, including start time, end time, duration, and completion status (finished vs. interrupted).

- **Note**: Text content attached to a task with creation and modification timestamps.

- **Reminder**: A notification trigger associated with a task's due date, containing timing rules and delivery preferences.

- **User**: The person using the application across multiple devices, with account credentials, preferences (including customizable Pomodoro work duration, short break duration, long break duration, and long break interval), and all associated tasks and data.

- **Report**: Aggregated analytics data showing Pomodoro sessions completed, tasks finished, and time distribution over a specified period.

- **Recurrence Rule**: Defines the repetition pattern for recurring tasks (frequency, interval, end conditions).
