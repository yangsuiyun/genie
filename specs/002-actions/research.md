# Research: GitHub Actions Pipeline Reliability

## Research Areas

### 1. GitHub Actions Reliability Best Practices

**Decision**: Implement retry mechanisms, timeout handling, and fallback strategies
**Rationale**: GitHub Actions can fail due to transient network issues, runner unavailability, or external service outages. Implementing proper error handling and retry logic increases success rates.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual monitoring and intervention (rejected - not scalable)
- Third-party CI/CD services (rejected - adds complexity)
- Self-hosted runners (rejected - adds infrastructure overhead)

### 2. Workflow Error Detection and Reporting

**Decision**: Use GitHub Actions status checks, workflow summaries, and notification mechanisms
**Rationale**: Built-in GitHub features provide comprehensive logging and status reporting without additional dependencies.
**Alternatives considered**:
- External monitoring services (rejected - adds cost and complexity)
- Custom logging infrastructure (rejected - reinventing existing functionality)

### 3. Dependency Validation and Caching

**Decision**: Implement pre-flight checks and aggressive caching strategies
**Rationale**: Validating dependencies before execution prevents mid-workflow failures. Caching reduces external dependency risks.
**Alternatives considered**:
- No validation (rejected - causes runtime failures)
- Manual dependency management (rejected - not maintainable)

### 4. Flutter and Go Build Reliability

**Decision**: Use official actions with version pinning and build artifact verification
**Rationale**: Official actions are maintained and tested. Version pinning ensures reproducible builds.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Latest version dependencies (rejected - can introduce breaking changes)
- Custom build scripts (rejected - more maintenance overhead)

### 5. Workflow Orchestration and Conflict Prevention

**Decision**: Use concurrency groups and workflow dependencies
**Rationale**: Prevents resource conflicts and ensures proper build ordering.
**Alternatives considered**:
- No orchestration (rejected - can cause race conditions)
- External orchestration tools (rejected - adds complexity)

### 6. Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**Decision**: Track workflow execution times, success rates, and resource usage
**Rationale**: Data-driven optimization identifies bottlenecks and trends.
**Alternatives considered**:
- No monitoring (rejected - can't identify issues)
- External monitoring (rejected - additional cost)

## Technology Decisions

### Retry Strategy
- **Pattern**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Max attempts**: 3 for network operations, 1 for build failures
- **Timeout**: 10 minutes per step, 60 minutes total workflow

### Error Handling
- **Strategy**: Fail-fast for critical errors, continue-on-error for optional steps
- **Notification**: GitHub issue creation for persistent failures
- **Logging**: Structured output with error classification

### Caching Strategy
- **Flutter**: Cache pub dependencies and build artifacts
- **Go**: Cache modules and build cache
- **Actions**: Cache setup steps (Flutter SDK, Go toolchain)

### Validation Approach
- **Pre-flight**: Validate environment, dependencies, and configuration
- **Post-build**: Verify artifacts, run smoke tests
- **Schema**: Validate workflow YAML against GitHub Actions schema
