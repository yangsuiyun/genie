# Feature Specification: GitHub Actions Pipeline Reliability

**Feature Branch**: `002-actions`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "现在已经有了actions流水线，只需要保障其能正常运行，解决过程中出现的所有问题"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team, we need our existing GitHub Actions pipeline to run consistently and reliably, so that we can trust our automated build and deployment processes without manual intervention or troubleshooting.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a GitHub Actions workflow exists, **When** code is pushed to the repository, **Then** the workflow should execute successfully without errors
2. **Given** a workflow encounters an error, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the system should provide clear diagnostic information and recovery guidance
3. **Given** workflow dependencies or environment issues arise, **When** these issues are detected, **Then** they should be automatically resolved or clearly reported
4. **Given** multiple workflows run concurrently, **When** resource contention occurs, **Then** workflows should complete without conflicts or failures
5. **Given** external dependencies are unavailable, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** appropriate fallback mechanisms should engage
6. **Given** workflow logs indicate issues, **When** problems are identified, **Then** actionable solutions should be provided

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GitHub Actions runners are unavailable or slow?
- How does the system handle network timeouts during dependency downloads?
- What occurs when repository permissions or secrets become invalid?
- How are memory or disk space limitations on runners managed?
- What happens when external services (package registries, etc.) are down?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and report workflow failures with specific error details
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically retry failed steps when appropriate [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what constitutes "appropriate" retry conditions?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate all required dependencies are available before execution
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear diagnostic information for troubleshooting failures
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle resource constraints gracefully without causing failures
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain workflow execution logs for debugging purposes
- **FR-007**: System MUST notify relevant stakeholders when workflows fail [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: who are the stakeholders and preferred notification method?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent conflicting workflows from running simultaneously when necessary
- **FR-009**: System MUST verify environment setup and configuration before executing workflows
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide rollback capabilities when deployments fail
- **FR-011**: System MUST monitor workflow performance and identify bottlenecks
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure consistent execution across different runner environments

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow Run**: Execution instance with status, logs, duration, and failure details
- **Build Artifact**: Generated outputs that must be preserved and accessible
- **Error Report**: Detailed diagnostic information about failures with resolution steps
- **Dependency**: External resources required for successful workflow execution
- **Environment State**: Current configuration of runners, secrets, and system resources
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution times, success rates, and resource usage data
