# Tasks: GitHub Actions Pipeline Reliability

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-actions/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Based on plan.md structure: Mobile + API with `.github/workflows/`, `scripts/`, `mobile/`, `backend/`

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create scripts directory structure: `scripts/{setup,validation,monitoring}/`
- [x] T002 Initialize workflow validation tools: yamllint, actionlint dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Configure GitHub Actions workflow linting in `.github/workflows/lint.yml`

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

### Contract Tests
- [x] T004 [P] Contract test GET /workflows/{workflow_name}/status in `scripts/validation/test_monitoring_api_status.sh`

- [x] T006 [P] Contract test GET /workflows/{workflow_name}/errors in `scripts/validation/test_monitoring_api_errors.sh`
- [x] T007 [P] Workflow schema validation test in `scripts/validation/test_workflow_schema.sh`

### Integration Tests
- [x] T008 [P] Integration test workflow reliability in `scripts/validation/test_workflow_reliability.sh`
- [x] T009 [P] Integration test error handling in `scripts/validation/test_error_handling.sh`
- [x] T010 [P] Integration test performance validation in `scripts/validation/test_performance_validation.sh`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

### Data Models
- [ ] T012 [P] WorkflowRun model in `scripts/monitoring/models/workflow_run.sh`

### Monitoring Services
- [ ] T016 [P] WorkflowStatusService in `scripts/monitoring/workflow_status_service.sh`
- [ ] T017 [P] MetricsCollectionService in `scripts/monitoring/metrics_collection_service.sh`
- [ ] T018 [P] ErrorReportingService in `scripts/monitoring/error_reporting_service.sh`

### Workflow Enhancements
- [ ] T019 Enhanced macOS workflow with reliability features in `.github/workflows/build-macos-app.yml`
- [ ] T020 Enhanced web workflow with reliability features in `.github/workflows/simple-web-build.yml`
- [ ] T021 Workflow validation and pre-flight checks in `scripts/validation/validate-workflows.sh`

### Core Monitoring Scripts
- [ ] T022 Performance monitoring script in `scripts/monitoring/performance-report.sh`
- [ ] T023 Error detection script in `scripts/monitoring/get-error-reports.sh`
- [ ] T024 SLA compliance checking in `scripts/validation/check-performance-sla.sh`

## Phase 3.4: Integration

### Setup and Initialization
- [ ] T025 Monitoring initialization script in `scripts/setup/init-monitoring.sh`
- [ ] T026 Dependency validation script in `scripts/validation/check-dependencies.sh`
- [ ] T027 Environment setup validation in `scripts/setup/validate-environment.sh`

### Retry and Recovery
- [ ] T028 Retry logic implementation in `scripts/monitoring/retry-logic.sh`
- [ ] T029 Failure recovery procedures in `scripts/monitoring/recovery-procedures.sh`
- [ ] T030 Notification system in `scripts/monitoring/notify-stakeholders.sh`

## Phase 3.5: Polish

### Unit Tests
- [ ] T031 [P] Unit tests for workflow models in `scripts/validation/unit/test_models.sh`
- [ ] T032 [P] Unit tests for monitoring services in `scripts/validation/unit/test_services.sh`

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T003) before all other phases
- Tests (T004-T011) before implementation (T012-T024)
- Models (T012-T015) before services (T016-T018)
- Core implementation (T019-T024) before integration (T025-T030)
- Integration before polish (T031-T038)

## Parallel Example
```bash
# Launch contract tests together (T004-T007):
Task: "Contract test GET /workflows/{workflow_name}/status in scripts/validation/test_monitoring_api_status.sh"
Task: "Contract test GET /workflows/{workflow_name}/metrics in scripts/validation/test_monitoring_api_metrics.sh"
Task: "Contract test GET /workflows/{workflow_name}/errors in scripts/validation/test_monitoring_api_errors.sh"
Task: "Workflow schema validation test in scripts/validation/test_workflow_schema.sh"

# Launch model creation together (T012-T015):
Task: "WorkflowRun model in scripts/monitoring/models/workflow_run.sh"
Task: "BuildArtifact model in scripts/monitoring/models/build_artifact.sh"
Task: "ErrorReport model in scripts/monitoring/models/error_report.sh"
Task: "PerformanceMetrics model in scripts/monitoring/models/performance_metrics.sh"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- All scripts should be executable and include proper error handling
- Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for GitHub Actions API interactions
- Follow constitutional requirements for code quality and documentation

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - monitoring-api.yaml → 3 contract test tasks [P] (T004-T006)
   - workflow-schema.yaml → 1 schema validation task [P] (T007)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 4 entities → 4 model creation tasks [P] (T012-T015)
   - Relationships → 3 service layer tasks [P] (T016-T018)

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Quickstart scenarios → 4 integration tests [P] (T008-T011)
   - Validation scenarios → polish tasks (T034-T038)

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Workflows → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution within same workflow files

- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files marked [P])
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Constitutional TDD principles followed
- [x] Performance and reliability requirements addressed
