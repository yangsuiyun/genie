# Feature Specification: GitHub Actions Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-github-action`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ÂÆûÁé∞ÂÄüÂä©github action"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team, we need automated build, test, and deployment processes triggered by code changes, so that we can ensure code quality and deliver features reliably without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** code is pushed to the main branch, **When** the push event occurs, **Then** automated workflows should trigger to build, test, and validate the application
2. **Given** a pull request is created, **When** the PR is opened or updated, **Then** quality checks should run automatically and report status back to the PR
3. **Given** a release tag is created, **When** the tag event occurs, **Then** production deployment workflows should execute automatically
4. **Given** workflow failures occur, **When** builds or tests fail, **Then** the team should be notified with clear error information
5. **Given** successful builds, **When** all checks pass, **Then** artifacts should be generated and made available for download or deployment

### Edge Cases
- What happens when workflows fail due to infrastructure issues?
- How does the system handle concurrent workflow executions?
- What occurs when repository secrets or permissions are invalid?
- How are workflow timeouts and resource limits managed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically trigger workflows when code changes are pushed to specified branches
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute build processes for multiple target platforms [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific platforms are required - web, mobile, desktop?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST run automated test suites and report results
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform code quality checks and static analysis
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate deployable artifacts for successful builds
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide workflow status feedback on pull requests
- **FR-007**: System MUST support scheduled workflow execution [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific schedules are needed?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST securely manage environment variables and secrets
- **FR-009**: System MUST enable manual workflow triggering when needed
- **FR-010**: System MUST retain workflow logs and artifacts for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]
- **FR-011**: System MUST notify team members of workflow failures [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification method not specified - email, Slack, etc.]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support conditional workflow execution based on file changes or other criteria

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow**: Automated process definition that specifies jobs, triggers, and execution conditions
- **Job**: Individual unit of work within a workflow containing one or more steps
- **Artifact**: Generated files or outputs from workflow execution (builds, test results, packages)
- **Secret**: Encrypted environment variables for secure credential management
- **Trigger Event**: Repository events that initiate workflow execution (push, pull request, release, schedule)
- **Workflow Run**: Specific execution instance of a workflow with status, logs, and results
